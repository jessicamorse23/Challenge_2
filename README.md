# Challenge_2
Personal website project for Jessica Morse

## Description
The project is a personal portfolio webpage built to showcase future deployed web applications. 
This webpage and the content displayed will eventually be able to showcase my skills
and talents to future employers. During this project I learned how to successfully 
utilize flexbox and CSS variables to create a webpage that shows aspects of my 
personal style. I also learned how to utilize media queries to to shrink the page 
so the elements fit on a mobile screen.
